                <article>
                    <p>C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the
                        1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features
                        cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating
                        systems, device
                        drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software, and is common in
                        computer
                        architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and
                        embedded
                        systems.</p>
                    <p> C is an imperative, procedural language in the ALGOL tradition. It has a static type system. In
                        C,
                        all executable code is contained within subroutines (also called "functions", though not in the
                        sense of
                        functional programming). Function parameters are passed by value, although arrays are passed as
                        pointers, i.e. the address of the first item in the array. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C
                        by
                        explicitly passing pointers to the thing being referenced.

                        C program source text is free-format, using the semicolon as a statement separator and curly
                        braces
                        for grouping blocks of statements.</p>
                    <p>The C language also exhibits the following characteristics: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The language has a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of control flow
                            primitives: if/else, for, do/while, while, and switch. User-defined names are not
                            distinguished
                            from keywords by any kind of sigil.</li>
                        <li>It has a large number of arithmetic, bitwise, and logic operators: +,+=,++,&,||, etc.</li>
                        <li>Data typing is static, but weakly enforced; all data has a type, but implicit conversions
                            are
                            possible.</li>
                        <li>Low-level access to computer memory is possible by converting machine addresses to pointers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Complex functionality such as I/O, string manipulation, and mathematical functions are
                            consistently
                            delegated to library routines.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, including C++, C#, Unix's C shell,
                    D,
                    Go, Java, JavaScript (including transpilers), Julia, Limbo, LPC, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python,
                    Ruby,
                    Rust, Swift, Verilog and SystemVerilog (hardware description languages).These languages have drawn
                    many of their control structures and other basic features from C. Most of them (Python being a
                    dramatic
                    exception) also express highly similar syntax to C, and they tend to combine the recognizable
                    expression
                    and statement syntax of C with underlying type systems, data models, and semantics that can be
                    radically
                    different.</p>

                <p>C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the
                    operating
                    system. C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as
                    fast
                    as the code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C are -</p>

                <p>A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a

                <p>In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be

            <article>
                <p>A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An
                    identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more
                    letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).

                    C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a
                    case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C.
                    Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers −</p>
